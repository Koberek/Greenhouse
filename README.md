# Greenhouse
My project is to control a small greenhouse. 10ft x 10ft x 7.5 tall arch. 9 tempreature sensors. 5 sensors reading soil temp(1 through 5).
Sensor 6 is Purge Water temp. Sensor 7 is GreenHouse temp. Sensor 8 is Outside Air temp. Sensor 9 is EXTRA

THESE files were written for the ADAFRUIT Metro M4 WiFi. This should work on the Arduino boards but may not compile without considerable changes to WiFi and NTP functions.

FUTURE work is to add a timer and reduce the frequency of NTP calls to get time.

FUTURE add a Web interface for displaying current envronment data (temp, humid, waterON, etc)
