# Greenhouse

Greenhouse.ino
Functions.ino (tabbed in Arduino IDE)

May 19 2020... 

My project is to control a small greenhouse. 10ft x 10ft x 7.5 tall arch. 5 sensors reading soil temp(1 through 5). Watering occurs 2x/day. Time-of-day comes from a locally connected RPi (USB serial).

I did not write any of the libraries. I just collected the libraries and added functions to suit my needs. I also used example code found on the net.

Has heater control and venting control base on temperature
