# Greenhouse
My project is to control a small greenhouse. 10ft x 10ft x 7.5 tall arch. 9 tempreature sensors. 5 sensors reading soil temp(1 through 5).
Sensor 6 is Purge Water temp. Sensor 7 is GreenHouse temp. Sensor 8 is Outside Air temp. Sensor 9 is EXTRA

THESE files are for the ADAFRUIT Metro M4 WiFi. This should work on the Arduino boards but may not compile without considerable changes to WiFi and NTP functions. I did not write any of the libraries. I just assembled the libraries and functions to suit my needs. I also used example code found on the net.

FUTURE work is to add a timer and reduce the frequency of NTP calls to get time.

FUTURE add a Web interface for displaying current envronment data (temp, humid, waterON, etc)
